                | conditions.
            p #[strong  3.5.  Third-Party Authentication.]
                | If your Application requires an End User to authenticate with a third-party
                | service (i.e., any authentication service other than Microsoft Account)
                | before the Application functions as intended, the Application must (a) make
                | it clear to the End User that they will be authenticating with the
                | third-party service, and (b) provide the End User with reasonable
                | information about any additional terms and conditions, privacy policy, and
                | End User data that is collected or used.
            p #[strong  4.   Other Developer Requirements and Policies]
            p #[strong  4.1.  Mixer's Values.]
                | Mixer's goal is to bring streamers and viewers together around the world's
                | fastest and only truly interactive streaming platform. Mixer's values are
                | represented by experiences and features that help achieve this goal, and
                | specifically that put community first, respect End Users' desires and
                | preferences, and enhance community, interactivity and fun. All aspects of
                | your Application and your development for the Service should aspire to the
                | same goals and experiences.
            p #[strong  4.2.  Commercialization of Applications.]
                | Microsoft is open to various ways you may wish to commercialize your
                | Application, provided that your Application, and the manner in which you
                | commercialize it, are at all times consistent with Mixer's values and this
                | Agreement.
            p #[strong  4.3.  Data Use.]
                | Much of the data accessible from the Service is public and free to End
                | Users in order to help achieve Mixer's goals, and in a manner that is
                | consistent with its values. Your use of data accessible from Mixer, whether
                | on its own or in combination with other data accessible to you, must be at
                | all times consistent with Mixer's values, Microsoft Policies, and this
                | Agreement. In addition, you may not sell any data you collect from Mixer,
                | or any business analytics or insights you derive from such data, without
                | Microsoft's prior written approval. Microsoft will deem any attempt to sell
                | such data without Microsoft's prior written approval as a conflict with
                | Mixer's values. You agree to take reasonable measures to ensure the
                | security of Mixer data in your possession.
            p  #[strong 4.4. Conflicts with Mixer's Values.]
                | If, in Microsoft's sole discretion, your Application, its
                | commercialization, or your use of data you access from Mixer conflicts with
                | Mixer's values, then Microsoft reserves the right to take any actions it
                | may deem appropriate under the circumstances. This may include, but is not
                | limited to: (a) contacting you to resolve concerns about your Application,
                | the manner of its commercialization, your use of data, etc., in which case
                | you agree to work with Microsoft in good faith to resolve these concerns,
                | (b) revoking your API Key, or (c) terminating this Agreement as provided in
                | Section 8. For the purpose of illustration only: if your Application
                | includes display ads for products that, in Microsoft's discretion, are not
                | appropriate for the Mixer community, then Microsoft may contact you to
                | request that you remove such ads from your Application.
            p #[strong  5.  Intellectual Property.]
            p #[strong  5.1.  Ownership.]
                | Intellectual property provided by one Party to the other Party in relation
                | to this Agreement will remain the sole and exclusive property of the
                | providing Party. Each of the Parties will take such action (including
                | signature and assistance in preparation of documents or the giving of
                | testimony) as may be requested by the providing Party to confirm such
                | providing Party's rights in and ownership of any intellectual property. All
                | goodwill, rights, and benefits in Microsoft Marks or Developer Marks
                | arising from use under this Agreement will inure to Microsoft or Developer,
                | respectively.
            p #[strong  5.2.  License to Feedback.]
                | Either Microsoft or Developer may voluntarily provide to the other
                | suggestions, comments or feedback about the other Party's products or
                | services (" #[strong Feedback]
                | "). Even if designated as confidential,
                | the receiver of Feedback may use it for any purpose without obligation of
                | any kind, except they may not disclose the source of Feedback to any third
                | party without consent of the Party providing it.
            p #[strong  5.3.  Licenses By Microsoft.]
                | If a specific license accompanies a specific Development Resource, then
                | that license applies to your use of that Development Resource. For any
                | Development Resource that is not accompanied by a specific license, then on
                | the condition that you comply in full with all Developer obligations and
                | requirements in this Agreement, Microsoft grants you (a) a limited,

                | nonexclusive, royalty free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to
                | reproduce, distribute and display the Microsoft Marks, subject to any usage
                | or brand guidelines we provide. Any right or license not expressly granted
                | by this Agreement is hereby reserved.
            p #[strong  5.4.  Licenses By Developer.]

                | perpetual, sublicensable license to publicly display and utilize your

                | may require you to deliver software to Microsoft for Microsoft to host or
                | execute in order for your Application to function in connection with the

                | transferable, perpetual, sublicensable license to reproduce, modify, create
                | derivative works from, distribute, and publicly display your Application in
                | connection with the Service. Developer also grants to Microsoft a
                | nonexclusive, royalty free, transferable, perpetual, sublicensable license

                | provide, subject to any usage or brand guidelines you may provide.
            p #[strong  6.  Privacy.]
            p #[strong  6.1.  Generally.]

                | regulations in their respective performance of their obligations under this
                | Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties each shall operate as
                | independent controllers of personal information associated with End Users
                | shared between them pursuant to this Agreement, subject to all other

                | of such notices.
            p #[strong  6.2.  Cookies.]
                | If your Application uses cookies to function as intended on any Microsoft
                | domain (e.g.,
                u https://www.mixer.com
                | ), then you must disclose this to
                | Microsoft and provide a brief description of the cookie name and purpose
                | before distributing your Application. Microsoft reserves the right to

            p #[strong  7.  Publicity.]
                | Either party may make positive, non-derogatory statements related to the

                | Agreement or the parties' relationship without the prior written consent of
                | the other party; provided, however, that it shall not be a breach of this
